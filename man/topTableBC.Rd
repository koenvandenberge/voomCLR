\title{Table of Top Genes from Linear Model Fit, using bias correction.}
\usage{
topTableBC(fit, coef = NULL, number = 10, genelist = fit$genes,
           adjust.method = "BH", sort.by = "B", resort.by = NULL,
           p.value = 1, fc = NULL, lfc = NULL, confint = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{list containing a linear model fit produced by \code{lmFit}, \code{lm.series}, \code{gls.series} or \code{mrlm}.
For \code{topTableBC}, \code{fit} should be an object of class \code{MArrayLM} as produced by \code{lmFit} and \code{eBayes}.}

\item{coef}{column number or column name specifying which coefficient or contrast of the linear model is of interest. For \code{topTableBC}, can also be a vector of column subscripts, in which case the gene ranking is by F-statistic for that set of contrasts.}

\item{number}{maximum number of features to list.}

\item{genelist}{data frame or character vector containing feature information.
For \code{topTableBC} only, this defaults to \code{fit$genes}.}

\item{adjust.method}{method used to adjust the p-values for multiple testing.  Options, in increasing conservatism, include \code{"none"}, \code{"BH"}, \code{"BY"} and \code{"holm"}.
See \code{\link{p.adjust}} for the complete list of options. A \code{NULL} value will result in the default adjustment method, which is \code{"BH"}.}

\item{sort.by}{character string specifying which statistic to rank the genes by.
Possible values for \code{topTableBC} are \code{"logFC"}, \code{"AveExpr"}, \code{"t"}, \code{"P"}, \code{"p"} or \code{"none"}.
(Permitted synonyms are \code{"M"} for \code{"logFC"}, \code{"A"} or \code{"Amean"} for \code{"AveExpr"}, \code{"T"} for \code{"t"} and \code{"p"} for \code{"P"}.)}

\item{resort.by}{character string specifying statistic to sort the selected genes by in the output data.frame.  Possibilities are the same as for \code{sort.by}.}

\item{fc}{Not implemented yet for \code{topTableBC}. optional minimum fold-change required.}

\item{lfc}{Not implemented yet for \code{topTableBC}. Optional minimum log-fold-change required, equal to \code{log2(fc)}.
\code{fc} and \code{lfc} are alternative ways to specify a fold-change cutoff and, if both are specified, then \code{fc} take precedence.
If specified, then the results from \code{topTableBC} will include only genes with (at least one) absolute log-fold-change greater than \code{lfc}.
This argument is not normally used with \code{topTreat}, which handles fold-change thresholds differently via the \code{treat} function.}

\item{confint}{logical, should confidence 95\% intervals be output for \code{logFC}?  Alternatively, can be a numeric value between zero and one specifying the confidence level required.}

\item{bootstrap}{Either \code{"nonparametric"}, \code{"parametric"} or \code{FALSE}. Should bootstrapping be performed to take into account uncertainty of the estimation of the bias correction term?}

\item{voomWeights}{Required when \code{bootstrap = "parametric"}. The observation-level heteroscedasticity weights after running \code{voomCLR}.
Recommended to use \code{v$weights}, with \code{v} the output from \code{voomCLR}.}

\item{contrastMatrix}{If \code{bootstrap="parametric"}, and you are working with a contrast matrix through \code{contrasts.fit},
then provide this contrast matrix and if needed subset it by the relevant column. See examples and vignette.}

\item{returnVars}{Logical: should all variance components be returned? Only applicable if using bootstrapping.}

\item{p.valuecutoff}{value for adjusted p-values. Only genes with lower p-values are listed.}

\item{dots}{other \code{topTreat} arguments are passed to \code{topTableBC}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with a row for the \code{number} top genes and the following columns:
\item{genelist}{one or more columns of probe annotation, if genelist was included as input}
\item{logFC}{estimate of the log-fold-change corresponding to the effect or contrast}
\item{CI.L}{left limit of confidence interval for \code{logFC} (if \code{confint=TRUE} or \code{confint} is numeric)}
\item{CI.R}{right limit of confidence interval for \code{logFC} (if \code{confint=TRUE} or \code{confint} is numeric)}
\item{AveExpr}{average log-expression for the probe over all arrays and channels, same as \code{Amean} in the \code{MarrayLM} object}
\item{t}{moderated t-statistic}
\item{F}{moderated F-statistic (omitted for \code{topTableBC} unless more than one coef is specified)}
\item{P.Value}{raw p-value}
\item{adj.P.Value}{adjusted p-value or q-value}

If \code{fit} had unique rownames, then the row.names of the above data.frame are the same in sorted order.
Otherwise, the row.names of the data.frame indicate the row number in \code{fit}.
If \code{fit} had duplicated row names, then these are preserved in the \code{ID} column of the data.frame, or in \code{ID0} if \code{genelist} already contained an \code{ID} column.

\details{
These functions summarize the linear model fit object produced by \code{lmFit}, \code{lm.series}, \code{gls.series} or \code{mrlm} by selecting the top-ranked genes for any given contrast, or for a set of contrasts.
\code{topTableBC} assumes that the linear model fit has already been processed by \code{\link{eBayes}}.
\code{topTreat} assumes that the fit has been processed by \code{\link{treat}}.

If \code{coef} has a single value, then the moderated t-statistics and p-values for that coefficient or contrast are used.
If \code{coef} takes two or more values, the moderated F-statistics for that set of coefficients or contrasts are used.
If \code{coef} is left \code{NULL}, then all the coefficients or contrasts in the fitted model are used, except that any coefficient named \code{(Intercept)} will be removed.

The p-values for the coefficient/contrast of interest are adjusted for multiple testing by a call to \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}.
The \code{"BH"} method, which controls the expected false discovery rate (FDR) below the specified value, is the default adjustment method because it is the most likely to be appropriate for microarray studies.
Note that the adjusted p-values from this method are bounds on the FDR rather than p-values in the usual sense.
Because they relate to FDRs rather than rejection probabilities, they are sometimes called q-values.
See \code{help("p.adjust")} for more information.

Note, if there is no good evidence for differential expression in the experiment, that it is quite possible for all the adjusted p-values to be large, even for all of them to be equal to one.
It is quite possible for all the adjusted p-values to be equal to one if the smallest p-value is no smaller than \code{1/ngenes} where \code{ngenes} is the number of genes with non-missing p-values.

The \code{sort.by} argument specifies the criterion used to select the top genes.
The choices are: \code{"logFC"} to sort by the (absolute) coefficient representing the log-fold-change; \code{"A"} to sort by average expression level (over all arrays) in descending order; \code{"T"} or \code{"t"} for absolute t-statistic; \code{"P"} or \code{"p"} for p-values; or \code{"B"} for the \code{lods} or B-statistic.

Normally the genes appear in order of selection in the output table.
If a different order is wanted, then the \code{resort.by} argument may be useful.
For example, \code{topTableBC(fit, sort.by="B", resort.by="logFC")} selects the top genes according to log-odds of differential expression and then orders the selected genes by log-ratio in decreasing order.
Or \code{topTableBC(fit, sort.by="logFC", resort.by="logFC")} would select the genes by absolute log-fold-change and then sort them from most positive to most negative.

Toptable output for all probes in original (unsorted) order can be obtained by \code{topTableBC(fit,sort="none",n=Inf)}.
However \code{\link{write.fit}} or \code{\link{write}} may be preferable if the intention is to write the results to a file.
A related method is \code{as.data.frame(fit)} which coerces an \code{MArrayLM} object to a data.frame.

By default \code{number} probes are listed.
Alternatively, by specifying \code{p.value} and \code{number=Inf}, all genes with adjusted p-values below a specified value can be listed.

The arguments \code{fc} and \code{lfc} give the ability to filter genes by log-fold change, but see the Note below.
This argument is not available for \code{topTreat} because \code{treat} already handles fold-change thresholding in a more sophisticated way.
}
\note{
Although \code{topTableBC} enables users to set both p-value and fold-change cutoffs, the use of fold-change cutoffs is not generally recommended.
If the fold changes and p-values are not highly correlated, then the use of a fold change cutoff can increase the false discovery rate above the nominal level.
Users wanting to use fold change thresholding are usually recommended to use \code{treat} and \code{topTreat} instead.

In general, the adjusted p-values returned by \code{adjust.method="BH"} remain valid as FDR bounds only when the genes remain sorted by p-value.
Resorting the table by log-fold-change can increase the false discovery rate above the nominal level for genes at the top of resorted table.
